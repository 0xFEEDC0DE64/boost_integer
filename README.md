# Boost.Integer

Boost.Integer, part of collection of the [Boost C++ Libraries](http://github.com/boostorg), provides
integer type support, particularly helpful in generic programming. It provides the means to select
an integer type based upon its properties, like the number of bits or the maximum supported value,
as well as compile-time bit mask selection. There is a derivative of `std::numeric_limits` that provides
integral constant expressions for `min` and `max`...
Finally, it provides two compile-time algorithms: determining the highest power of two in a.
compile-time value; and computing min and max of constant expressions.
